invite-o-matic
==============

The invite-o-matic idea came out of a Constellation District membership committee meeting in the Cradle of Liberty council in the early Summer of 2014.

The thought was most Scouts are also members of sports teams. What if we could give those Scouts an easy way to generate an email that they could send to the other members of their sports teams in a quiet, private way.

So on a coffee-fueled morning in late July, I sat down and coded up version 1.0 of this little application.

As with any Scouting project, suggestions, collaboration ideas, etc. are all welcome.

Let's see what comes out of this.
